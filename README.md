# Deep L-Layer Neural Network for Cat Image Classification

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Objective

In this report, I have successfully built a cat/not-a-cat classifier by leveraging functions from a previous assignment to construct a deep network. The primary aim was to achieve an improved level of accuracy compared to the earlier logistic regression implementation.

Through this project, I have acquired crucial skills, including the ability to build and train a deep L-layer neural network, thus enabling me to tackle more complex supervised learning tasks. Additionally, I have applied this neural network to the specific task of classifying cat images from non-cat images.
